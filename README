Famzilla - Filezilla Theme
--------------------------

In late 2009 I decided to put together a new Filezilla theme based on Mark James Fam Fam Fam: Silk Mini icon set. This theme was initially published on my blog back in April 2011

![Famzilla running on Ubuntu 9.10](http://www.otq.za.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/famzilla-preview.png)

# Installation on Linux
Download as a zip file or clone the repo then run:

    $ sudo bin/install.sh

# Installation on Windows

1. Extract the contents of famzilla.zip to a folder or desktop
2. Move the "famzilla" folder from the src directory to C:\Program Files\Filezilla\resources\

# Selecting the theme

1. Launch Filezilla
2. Go to *Edit* > *Preferences / Settings*
3. Scroll down to *Interface* and select *Themes*
4. Select the theme “FamZilla” from the drop down menu
5. Click *Ok*

That’s it and I hope you enjoy the theme!

# Known Issues / Bugs

1. [Speed limit icon isn't updated when changing themes](http://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/7247/).
2. [Speed Limits icon distorted without 48×48 version](http://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/7246).
3. Folder icons don’t reload immediately when loading a new theme. Simply restart Filezilla to fix the problem.
